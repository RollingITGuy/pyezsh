# pyezsh MVP Demo Guide

This document outlines a simple demo flow for the pyezsh MVP.

## Demo Steps

1. Launch the application.
2. Observe the multi-pane layout:
   - Sidebar (filesystem)
   - Content viewer
   - Properties pane
   - Telemetry/status area
3. Expand a directory in the sidebar.
4. Select a directory:
   - Content pane shows a summary
   - Properties pane updates with the path
5. Select a text file:
   - Content pane previews file contents
   - Large or binary files show a friendly message
6. Use a menu item (e.g., File → New):
   - Status/telemetry reflects the action

## Expected Behavior

- Sidebar selection updates all other panes
- No crashes during normal navigation
- UI remains responsive during interaction

This demo reflects the intended MVP scope.
